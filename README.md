# COX-2-drug-prediction-
Using the ChEMBL database, I have taken know drugs that's have been tested for the the drug target:Cyclooxygenase 2 a known protein that produces prostaglandins that causes inflammation. I have processed the data and stroed in a dataframe including its know properties. Using the pIC50 values, I determined if the known tested drugs for this drug target is affect or not in inhibiting the protein,COX-2. I also used the lipinski rule of five and the veber rule to determine if the known chemicals are sound for oral use. At the end using the Padl software, I got the desciptors for the tested drugs, and created a model to predict the effectiveness of new drugs that are used to target the COX-2 protein.
